## Project Structure :

I've organized the  project using the Repository pattern and separated functionalities into class libraries:

- **OT.Assessment.App**: This is the main API project.
- **OT.Assessment.Consumer**: Manages published messages and sends them to the service for processing.
- **OT.Assessment.Migrations**: Handles database migrations and entity configurations; this is where the context class is located.
- **OT.Assessment.Model**: Stores all entities, DTOs, request models, and response classes.
- **OT.Assessment.Core**: Contains enums, extension methods, helper classes, and static response classes.
- **OT.Assessment.Repository**: Includes all generic repository classes and the unit of work.
- **OT.Assessment.Services**: Contains business logic and the producer/publisher, which I considered separating but decided against to avoid an overkill.

I was very concerned about this part: "receives player casino wager events to publish to the local RabbitMQ queue." Should I just publish and move on? How can I notify the requester about the status of their request?
It seems like my best option is to "publish and forget," since I don't want the requester to have to wait for RabbitMQ to finish processing.
The lest i did was to just check if the publishing to the queue was successful and return an appropriate response. However, this might be misleading, as the publish can succeed, but issues could still arise later, such as validation errors or unexpected problems during SQL operations.
